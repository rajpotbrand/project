<h2>EARLY LIFE AND FAMILY</h2>
<p>Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[9] Earlier, some reports suggest he was born on 25 November 1952.[10][11][12][13] It was reported that 5 October was wrongly mentioned by Pakistan Cricket Board officials on his passport.[14] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[15] Long settled in Mianwali in northwestern Punjab, his paternal family are of Pashtun descent and belong to the Niazi tribe,[16][17] and one of his ancestors, Haibat Khan Niazi, in the 16th century, "was one of Sher Shah Suri's leading generals, as well as being the governor of Punjab."[18] Khan's mother was of Ormur descent, who are a separate ethnic group but are included in the Pashtun tribal system, and whose ancestors had been settled in the Jalandhar district of Punjab for centuries. Following the independence and establishment of Pakistan, she migrated to Lahore with the rest of Khan's maternal relatives.[19] Khan's maternal family has produced a number of cricketers, including those who have represented Pakistan,[15] such as his cousins Javed Burki and Majid Khan.[16] Maternally, Khan is also a descendant of the Sufi warrior-poet and inventor of the Pashto alphabet, Pir Roshan, who hailed from his maternal family's ancestral Kaniguram town located in South Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[20] His maternal family was based in Basti Danishmanda, Jalandhar for about 600 years.[21][22]</p><br>Khan was born in Lahore on 5 October 1952.[9] Earlier, some reports suggest he was born on 25 November 1952.[10][11][12][13] It was reported that 5 October was wrongly mentioned by Pakistan Cricket Board officials on his passport.[14] He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer, and his wife Shaukat Khanum, and has four sisters.[15] Long settled in Mianwali in northwestern Punjab, his paternal family are of Pashtun descent and belong to the Niazi tribe,[16][17] and one of his ancestors, Haibat Khan Niazi, in the 16th century, "was one of Sher Shah Suri's leading generals, as well as being the governor of Punjab."[18] Khan's mother was of Ormur descent, who are a separate ethnic group but are included in the Pashtun tribal system, and whose ancestors had been settled in the Jalandhar district of Punjab for centuries.

<h2>CRICKET CAREER</h2>
<img src="images/IMRAN KHAN2.jpg">
<P>Khan made his first debut at the age of 16 in Lahore. By the start of the 1970s, he was playing for his home teams of Lahore A (1969–70), Lahore B (1969–70), Lahore Greens (1970–71) and, eventually, Lahore (1970–71).[71] Khan was part of the University of Oxford's Blues Cricket team during the 1973–1975 seasons.</P>
<P>He played English county cricket from 1971 to 1976 for Worcestershire. During this decade, other teams represented by Khan included Dawood Industries (1975–1976) and Pakistan International Airlines (1975–1976 to 1980–1981). From 1983 to 1988, he played for Sussex.[72]

Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[73] Three years later, in August 1974, he debuted in the One Day International (ODI) match, once again playing against England at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[73] After graduating from Oxford and finishing his tenure at Worcestershire, he returned to Pakistan in 1976 and secured a permanent place on his native national team starting from the 1976–1977 season, during which they faced New Zealand and Australia.[71] Following the Australian series, he toured the West Indies, where he met Tony Greig, who signed him up for Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket.[72] His credentials as one of the fastest bowlers in the world started to become established when he finished third at 139.7 km/h in a fast bowling contest at Perth in 1978, behind Jeff Thomson and Michael Holding, but ahead of Dennis Lillee, Garth Le Roux and Andy Roberts.[74] During the late 1970s, Khan was one of the pioneers of the reverse swing bowling technique. He imparted this trick to the bowling duo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who mastered and popularised this art in later years.</P>
<P>As a bowler, Khan initially bowled with a relatively chest-on action, at medium-pace.[76] However he worked hard to remodel his action to a more classical type, and to strengthen his body, to enable fast bowling.[77][78] Khan attained his prime as a fast bowler in January 1980 till 1988 when he became out and out fast bowler. During this span Imran picked 236 test wickets at 17.77 apiece with 18 five-wicket hauls and 5 10 wicket hauls. His bowling average and strike rate were better than Richard Hadlee (19.03), Malcolm Marshall (20.20), Dennis Lillee (24.07), Joel Garner (20.62) and Michael Holding (23.68).[79][80] In January 1983, playing against India, he attained a Test bowling rating of 922 points. Although calculated retrospectively (International Cricket Council (ICC) player ratings did not exist at the time), Khan's form and performance during this period ranks third in the ICC's All-Time Test Bowling Rankings.[81]

Khan achieved the all-rounder's triple (securing 3000 runs and 300 wickets) in 75 Tests, the second-fastest record behind Ian Botham's 72. He also has the second-highest all-time batting average of 61.86 for a Test batsman playing at position 6 in the batting order.[82] He played his last Test match for Pakistan in January 1992, against Sri Lanka at Faisalabad. Khan retired permanently from cricket six months after his last ODI, the historic 1992 World Cup final against England in Melbourne, Australia.[83] He ended his career with 88 Test matches, 126 innings and scored 3807 runs at an average of 37.69, including six centuries and 18 fifties. His highest score was 136. As a bowler, he took 362 wickets in Test cricket, which made him the first Pakistani and world's fourth bowler to do so.[72] In ODIs, he played 175 matches and scored 3709 runs at an average of 33.41. His highest score was 102 not out. His best ODI bowling was 6 wickets for 14 runs, a record for the best bowling figures by any bowler in an ODI innings in a losing cause.</P>
<h2>POLITICAL CAREER</h2>
<img src="images/IMRAN KHAN3.jpg">
<P>Basing his wider paradigm on the poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal and the Iranian writer-sociologist Ali Shariati he came across in his youth,[122] Khan is generally described as a nationalist[123] and a populist.[124] Khan's proclaimed political platform and declarations include: Islamic values, to which he rededicated himself in the 1990s; liberal economics, with the promise of deregulating the economy and creating a welfare state; decreased bureaucracy and the implementation of anti-corruption laws, to create and ensure a clean government; the establishment of an independent judiciary; overhaul of the country's police system; and an anti-militant vision for a democratic Pakistan.[125][97][126][127]

After the result of 2018 Pakistani general election, Imran Khan said he would try to remake Pakistan based on the ideology of Muhammad Ali Jinnah.[128]

During his government, Khan addressed a balance of payments crisis with a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.[129] He presided over a shrinking current account deficit,[130][131] and limited defence spending to curtail the fiscal deficit,[132][133] leading to some general economic growth.[134][132][133][135] He enacted policies which increased tax collection[136][137] and investment,[138] and reforms were made to the social safety net. His government committed to a renewable energy transition, launched a national reforestation initiative and expanded protected areas, and led the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. His government committed to a renewable energy transition, launched the Ehsaas Programme and the Plant for Pakistan initiative, and expanded the protected areas of Pakistan. He presided over the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused economic turmoil and rising inflation in the country, and threatened his political position.[139] He enacted policies that increased tax collection[136][137] and investment.[140]

However, his failure to revive the economy and the rising inflation rate caused him political problems.[139] Despite his promised anti-corruption campaign, the perception of corruption in Pakistan worsened during his rule.[141] He was accused of political victimisation of opponents and clamping down on freedom of expression and dissent.[142]

On 10 April 2022, Khan became the country's first prime minister to be ousted through a no-confidence motion vote in parliament. On 22 August 2022, Khan was charged by the Pakistani police under anti-terror laws after Khan accused the police and judiciary of detaining and torturing his close aide.</P>
